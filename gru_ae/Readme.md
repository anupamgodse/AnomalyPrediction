The directory src/ contains all the necessary scripts.

	* online_prediction.py is used to predict anomalies by connecting to the broker used for experiments.
	* evaluations.py conducts an experiment, for window sizes 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15 and 20 on cpu and memory.
	* evalutations.py will train, save and evaluate the models needed, and then generate required results.
	* report_generation.py will generate the results in results/
	* use any as $python3 [file].py

The directory results/
	
	* results.txt containts metrics for all window sizes, evaluated by evaluations.py and report_generation.py
	* cpu/ and memory/ contains ROC curves for the mentioned window sizes in evaluations.py

The directory models/

	* contains saved models from experiments in evaluations.py and online_prediction.py

The directory data/ contains data collected 44.1hrs normal and 44.3 hrs with falt injections.
